<p>Data analyst, programming hack, and a (moderately) reformed biologist; this is my place to share what I come across, a bit of what I'm doing, and a fun grab bag of anything else. </p>
<p>In all honesty though, outside of the obligatory cat pictures you can expect that this will be my place to talk about code, languages, computers, and the other parts that I deal with daily.  Hopefully it will be useful, maybe not, but nonetheless here it is.</p>
<p>Otherwise, as a fair warning, I'm a heavy vi user, spend most of my time on the command line, write in python, and am frequently confused by GUIs.  Outside of that I'm generally interested in mathematics, technology, and proper analysis of the data that we all swim in.</p>
<p>As for myself, I'm a <strong><a href="http://amaral-lab.org/people/pah">graduate student</a></strong> at Northwestern University, conducting my doctoral research in the Amaral Laboratory. My research is biologically focused for the most part, but I take many steps and projects outside of that domain. Also, due to my current position, I have many opinions about biology, graduate school, academic research, and other related topics that may creep into this blog.</p>
